Hello, I'm Drako0812 (or just Drako)! Welcome to my revamped homepage. I'm excited to announce that I've hit the first self-imposed milestone for the game that I'm working on, **Two Dudes Run a Scrap Shop**. There isn't a lot to see, yet. But I did record a video of what I have done so far. Stay tuned to see more updates about this project.
