Today, I would like to announce that I am putting effort into two major things in the developer part of my life:

1. I am going to be spending a significant chunk of my time studying the ins and outs of full-stack web development as that seems to be the easiest way to break into the software development industry at this time. The overwhelming majority of my previous experiences have been oriented towards game and systems programming, so this will be quite the adjustment.
2. I'm not abandoning my passions. I also want to work on (yet another ðŸ˜¬) fantasy console, and this time finish it, or at least to the point that I feel comfortable adding it to my professional portfolio. At this time I'm calling it **DraCon**.

Stay tuned to this blog for more updates.
